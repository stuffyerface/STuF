# STuF
Standardized Truncated url Format is a url conversion format that removes redundancies and makes links no longer look like links.


The purpose of **STuF** is *NOT* to send encrypted messages. All people can easily decypher links sent this way, and that is the intent. This transforms your links into shorter strings that can only be read by users who want to read them. As long as you and the other End User have similar software as found in this repo, you can send and receive obfuscated links.

This gives power to end users and allows them to decide for themselves what they do and do not wish to see. The end user also assumes the responsibility of moderating what they view.
